gRPC uses the HTTP/2 protocol for communication between the client and the server. When a client wants to call a method on a gRPC service, it creates a stub object that provides a method for each of the methods defined in the service interface.

Here are the high-level steps of how a gRPC call works:

Client calls a method: The client calls a method on the stub object provided by the gRPC client library. The stub object takes care of serializing the method parameters into a binary format that can be transmitted over the wire.

Request is sent to the server: The serialized request is sent over an HTTP/2 connection to the gRPC server. The server responds with the serialized response.

Server processes the request: The server receives the request and deserializes it back into its original format. It then processes the request and generates a response.

Response is sent to the client: The serialized response is sent back over the HTTP/2 connection to the client. The client then deserializes the response and returns it to the calling code.

Under the hood, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the default serialization format, but it also supports other formats like JSON and XML. The use of HTTP/2 allows for efficient multiplexing of multiple RPCs over a single connection, as well as support for server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming.

Overall, gRPC offers a modern and efficient approach to remote procedure calls, making it a popular choice for building microservices and other distributed systems.
