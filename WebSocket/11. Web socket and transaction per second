WebSocket is not directly related to transaction per second (TPS), which is a measure of the number of transactions that can be processed by a system in a given time period.

WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, which can be used to build applications that require real-time updates and collaboration. The number of WebSocket connections that can be handled by a server depends on various factors such as the server resources, network infrastructure, and the complexity of the application.

On the other hand, TPS is a measure of how many transactions a system can handle in a given time period, which is often used in the context of financial trading, online payments, and other high-volume transactional systems. TPS depends on factors such as the processing power of the system, the efficiency of the algorithms used, and the network latency.

While WebSocket can be used to build applications that process a large number of real-time transactions, it is not directly related to the TPS of a system. However, WebSocket can be used to enable real-time updates and collaboration in high-volume transactional systems, which can enhance the user experience and improve the overall efficiency of the system.
