A webhook API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two software applications to communicate with each other in real-time, where one application sends data to another application through a webhook. A webhook is a mechanism that allows an application to send data automatically to another application when an event occurs in the first application. The second application can then receive and process the data, often triggering a specific action or behavior.

Webhook APIs are commonly used in web development, particularly in integrating different software systems. For example, an e-commerce website might use a webhook to automatically send order data to a shipping or inventory management system. Similarly, a messaging app might use a webhook to notify a third-party app when a new message arrives.

Webhook APIs are often more efficient and reliable than traditional polling methods, where an application repeatedly checks for new data at regular intervals. With a webhook, the receiving application is immediately notified when new data is available, reducing the latency and load on both applications.
