The strong points of webhooks include:

Real-time notifications: Webhooks provide real-time notifications, allowing web applications to receive immediate updates when an event occurs. This can be important for time-sensitive tasks and workflows.

Simplified integration: Webhooks simplify integration between different systems and applications. By providing a standard mechanism for data exchange, webhooks eliminate the need for custom integration code and reduce the risk of errors and compatibility issues.

Flexibility: Webhooks are highly flexible and can be used to integrate different types of systems and data sources. This makes them well-suited for complex workflows and scenarios where data needs to be shared between multiple applications and services.

Efficient processing: Because webhooks are initiated by the source system, they can reduce the load on the target system by avoiding the need for continuous polling or querying. This can lead to more efficient processing and lower resource usage.

Security: Webhooks can be secured using HTTPS and authentication mechanisms, ensuring that data is transmitted securely and only authorized systems are able to receive and process the data payload.

Overall, webhooks provide a powerful and efficient mechanism for integrating different systems and automating workflows. By providing real-time notifications and simplifying data exchange, webhooks can help businesses improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and streamline processes.
