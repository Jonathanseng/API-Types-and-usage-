The maximum number of transactions per second that a SOAP API can handle depends on various factors, such as the hardware and network resources, the complexity of the SOAP API, and the specific implementation of the SOAP API.

In general, modern SOAP API implementations can handle a high volume of transactions per second. However, the exact number can vary widely depending on the factors mentioned above. It is not uncommon for SOAP APIs to be capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second.

That being said, it's important to note that the maximum number of transactions per second that a SOAP API can handle is not a fixed number. It can vary based on the specific conditions under which the API is being used, such as the size and complexity of the messages being sent and received, the network latency, and the number of concurrent connections.

In practice, the performance of a SOAP API is often measured in terms of its throughput and latency, rather than the maximum number of transactions per second. Throughput measures the amount of data that can be processed by the API in a given time period, while latency measures the time it takes for the API to respond to a request. These metrics can provide a more accurate picture of the performance of the API under realistic conditions.
