An example of a webhook in action could be in a web application that allows users to sign up for a newsletter. When a user fills out the newsletter sign-up form and submits it, the web application could use a webhook to automatically add the user's information to a mailing list in a third-party email marketing platform.

Here's how the process might work:

A user fills out the newsletter sign-up form on the web application and submits it.
The web application receives the form data and sends it to a webhook endpoint URL provided by the email marketing platform.
The email marketing platform receives the webhook payload containing the user's information and adds it to the appropriate mailing list.
The email marketing platform may then send a confirmation email or trigger a welcome email sequence to the user.
In this example, the webhook allows the web application and email marketing platform to integrate seamlessly and automate the process of adding new users to the mailing list. By using webhooks, the process is streamlined and efficient, with no manual effort required to transfer the user's information from the web application to the email marketing platform.
