There are various software tools and frameworks that can be used to create a webhook, depending on the programming language and environment you are working with. Here are some examples:

Node.js: If you are working with JavaScript, Node.js is a popular server-side runtime that can be used to create webhooks. It includes the http and https modules that can be used to receive and respond to webhook requests. You can use frameworks like Express or Koa to simplify the process of creating a webhook API.

Flask: Flask is a Python-based microframework that can be used to create webhooks. It includes the Flask class that can be used to create a web application and the request module that can be used to receive and parse webhook requests.

Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that includes the ActionController module that can be used to create a webhook endpoint. You can define a controller action that handles webhook requests and processes the data.

PHP: If you are working with PHP, you can use frameworks like Laravel or Symfony to create a webhook API. These frameworks include routing and request handling functionality that can be used to receive and process webhook requests.

Java: If you are working with Java, you can use frameworks like Spring or Jersey to create a webhook API. These frameworks include classes and annotations that can be used to define and handle webhook requests.

In addition to these frameworks, there are also many cloud-based services and platforms that provide webhook functionality, such as Zapier, IFTTT, and AWS Lambda. These platforms can simplify the process of creating and managing webhooks, but may require some programming knowledge to set up and use effectively.
