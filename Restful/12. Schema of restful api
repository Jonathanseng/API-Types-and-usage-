RESTful APIs do not have a schema in the same way that GraphQL APIs do. Instead, they typically use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.

Here's an example of a simple RESTful API schema for a hypothetical "users" resource:

GET /users - Retrieves a list of users
GET /users/{id} - Retrieves a specific user by ID
POST /users - Creates a new user
PUT /users/{id} - Updates an existing user by ID
DELETE /users/{id} - Deletes an existing user by ID

In this schema, the GET method is used to retrieve a list of users or a specific user by ID. The POST method is used to create a new user, and the PUT method is used to update an existing user by ID. Finally, the DELETE method is used to delete an existing user by ID.

This is just a basic example, but RESTful APIs can support a wide range of resources and operations using HTTP methods and URLs to provide a consistent and standardized interface for accessing and manipulating resources.
