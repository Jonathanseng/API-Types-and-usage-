WebSocket has several limitations that may affect its use in certain situations:

Browser compatibility: Although most modern browsers support WebSocket, some older browsers do not, which may limit the reach of applications that rely on WebSocket.

Network infrastructure compatibility: WebSocket may not be compatible with existing network infrastructure, such as load balancers and firewalls, which may need to be configured to allow WebSocket traffic.

Resource consumption: Since WebSocket maintains a persistent connection between clients and servers, it can increase the load on the server, especially if a large number of clients are connected simultaneously.

Security concerns: WebSocket uses a persistent connection, which can increase the risk of security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of attacks. Proper security measures should be implemented to mitigate these risks.

Lack of reliable delivery: WebSocket does not provide built-in reliable delivery mechanisms. If reliable delivery is required, it must be implemented on top of WebSocket.

Complexity: WebSocket requires a server-side implementation to establish the connection and handle the communication between clients and servers. This may require additional server resources and may increase the complexity of the application architecture.

Overall, while WebSocket provides powerful real-time communication capabilities, it also has several limitations and potential challenges that need to be considered when building applications that rely on it.
