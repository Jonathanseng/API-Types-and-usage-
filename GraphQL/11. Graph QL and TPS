GraphQL itself does not provide a way to handle transactions per second (TPS) as it is a query language and specification for APIs, not a database or storage system. The TPS of a GraphQL API will depend on the implementation and infrastructure used.

However, there are some best practices and strategies that can be used to optimize the performance of a GraphQL API and handle higher TPS. Here are a few examples:

Caching: Caching can be an effective way to reduce the load on your GraphQL server and improve performance. Consider using a caching layer such as Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data or expensive queries.

Batched requests: Batched requests can help reduce the number of HTTP requests made to your GraphQL server, improving performance. Consider using a library like DataLoader to automatically batch and cache requests from your client.

Schema design: Well-designed schemas can help improve query performance by reducing the number of database queries needed to fulfill a request. Consider using tools like GraphQL schema stitching to combine multiple schemas into a single API that can be optimized for performance.

Infrastructure scaling: As traffic to your GraphQL API grows, you may need to scale your infrastructure to handle the increased load. Consider using auto-scaling services like AWS Auto Scaling or Google Cloud Autoscaling to automatically add or remove server instances based on traffic.

Query optimization: Optimizing your GraphQL queries can also help improve performance. Consider using tools like GraphQL query complexity analysis to identify expensive or inefficient queries, and use caching and pagination to reduce the amount of data that needs to be fetched from your database.

By implementing these strategies, you can help improve the performance and handle higher TPS for your GraphQL API.
