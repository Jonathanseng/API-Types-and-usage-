REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that uses HTTP as its communication protocol. A RESTful API is a web service that follows the REST architecture principles. RESTful APIs provide a way for applications to interact with a server in a stateless manner, meaning that each request from the client contains all the information necessary for the server to fulfill that request, without any state being stored on the server.

Some common applications of RESTful APIs include:

Web applications: RESTful APIs are commonly used to provide data to web applications, which can then display that data to users in a user-friendly way. For example, a weather app might use a RESTful API to get weather data from a server and display it to the user.

Mobile applications: RESTful APIs are also commonly used to provide data to mobile applications. Mobile apps can use RESTful APIs to access data stored on a server, such as user profiles, product information, or other types of data.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices: RESTful APIs are also used in IoT devices to enable them to communicate with other devices or with servers over the internet. For example, a smart thermostat might use a RESTful API to get weather data from a server and adjust its temperature settings accordingly.

Microservices: RESTful APIs are often used to build microservices, which are small, independent services that work together to form a larger application. Each microservice typically exposes a RESTful API that other microservices can use to access its functionality.

Overall, RESTful APIs are a widely used and versatile technology that can be used in a variety of applications, ranging from web and mobile applications to IoT devices and microservices.
