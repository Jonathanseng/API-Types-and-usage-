Here is an example of a RESTful API endpoint for retrieving a list of users:

HTTP Method: GET
URL: https://example.com/api/users

Response:

{
    "users": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john@example.com"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jane Smith",
            "email": "jane@example.com"
        }
    ]
}


In this example, a GET request is sent to the server at the specified URL, which is an API endpoint for retrieving a list of users. The server responds with a JSON object containing an array of user objects, each with an ID, name, and email.

This is a simple example, but RESTful APIs can be used to perform a wide range of CRUD operations on resources, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
