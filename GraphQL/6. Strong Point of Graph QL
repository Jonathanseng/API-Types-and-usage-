GraphQL has several strengths that make it a popular choice for building APIs. Here are some of its strong points:

Flexible and efficient data fetching: GraphQL's ability to allow clients to request only the data they need in a single request makes it a more efficient and flexible choice than traditional REST APIs. This can reduce network overhead and improve performance.

Strong typing system: GraphQL's strong typing system allows you to define your data schema and enforce strict type checking. This can help prevent errors and make it easier to maintain your API over time.

Introspection and documentation: GraphQL provides powerful introspection capabilities that allow clients to discover and explore your API. This can help developers understand your API and develop applications more quickly.

Easy to evolve and version: GraphQL's flexible nature makes it easy to add new features and fields to your API without breaking existing clients. This can make it easier to evolve your API over time and avoid the need for versioning.

Tooling and community support: GraphQL has a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries, as well as a large and active community. This can make it easier to get started with GraphQL and find solutions to common problems.

These are just a few of the strong points of GraphQL. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may find other benefits to using GraphQL as well.
