WebSocket has several strong points that make it a popular choice for real-time communication between clients and servers:

Real-time communication: WebSocket provides a real-time, bidirectional communication channel between clients and servers, enabling instant updates and interactions between them.

Reduced latency: Since WebSocket maintains a persistent connection between the client and server, data can be transmitted immediately, reducing the latency and improving the responsiveness of the application.

Improved efficiency: WebSocket uses a single, persistent connection instead of multiple, short-lived connections, reducing the overhead of establishing and tearing down connections, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced bandwidth usage.

Support for binary data: WebSocket supports the transmission of binary data, in addition to text data, making it suitable for applications that require the transfer of large volumes of data, such as media streaming or file transfers.

Cross-platform support: WebSocket is supported by most modern web browsers and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile and widely used technology.

Overall, the real-time, bidirectional communication capabilities of WebSocket, combined with its reduced latency, improved efficiency, support for binary data, and cross-platform compatibility, make it a strong choice for building real-time, interactive applications.
